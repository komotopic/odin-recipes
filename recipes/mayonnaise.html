        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>Mayonaisse is a thick, cold, and creamy sauce commonly used on sandwiches, hamburgers, composed salads, and French fries. It also forms the base for various other sauces, such as tartar sauce, fry sauce, remoulade, salsa golf, ranch dressing, and rouille.</p>

        <p>Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and an acid, either vinegar or lemon juice; there are many variants using additional flavorings. The color varies from near-white to pale yellow, and its texture from a light cream to a thick gel.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) neutral flavored oil, grapeseed, safflower or canola are best</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add egg to the small bowl of a food processor and process for 20 seconds. Add the mustard, vinegar, and salt. Process for another 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, turn the food processor on then begin to slowly add the oil in tiny drops until about a quarter of the oil has been added (this is critical for proper emulsification).</li>
            <li>When you notice that the mixture is beginning to thicken and emulsify, you can be a little less strict. With the processor on, continue to add it slowly, but increase to a very thin stream instead of drops of oil.</li>
            <li>When all of the oil has been added, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl and process for an extra 10 seconds. Taste mayonnaise for seasoning then add salt, and extra vinegar to taste.</li>
        </ol>
