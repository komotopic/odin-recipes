        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>Salsa verde is a type of spicy, green sauce in Mexican cuisine based on tomatillo and green chili peppers.

            The tomatillo-based Mexican salsa verde dates to the Aztec Empire, as documented by the Spanish physician Francisco Hern√°ndez, and is distinct from the various medieval European parsley-based green sauces.</p>

            <p>
                This green sauce comes in subtypes: cooked sauce, in which the ingredients are cooked and then ground; roasted salsa, in which the elements are roasted on a comal and then ground; raw sauce, in which ingredients are ground and eaten without cooking; and a combination in which some of the elements are cooked. A molcajete or a blender can be used for the grinding process. Cooking or roasting the tomatillo will enhance the flavor, providing a sweeter salsa.[2] After the sauce is prepared, it can be cooked again in a pan with a little oil.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) neutral flavored oil, grapeseed, safflower or canola are best</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add egg to the small bowl of a food processor and process for 20 seconds. Add the mustard, vinegar, and salt. Process for another 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, turn the food processor on then begin to slowly add the oil in tiny drops until about a quarter of the oil has been added (this is critical for proper emulsification).</li>
            <li>When you notice that the mixture is beginning to thicken and emulsify, you can be a little less strict. With the processor on, continue to add it slowly, but increase to a very thin stream instead of drops of oil.</li>
            <li>When all of the oil has been added, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl and process for an extra 10 seconds. Taste mayonnaise for seasoning then add salt, and extra vinegar to taste.</li>
            
        </ol>
