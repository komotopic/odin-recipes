        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>Salsa verde is a type of spicy, green sauce in Mexican cuisine based on tomatillo and green chili peppers.

            The tomatillo-based Mexican salsa verde dates to the Aztec Empire, as documented by the Spanish physician Francisco Hern√°ndez, and is distinct from the various medieval European parsley-based green sauces.</p>

            <p>
                This green sauce comes in subtypes: cooked sauce, in which the ingredients are cooked and then ground; roasted salsa, in which the elements are roasted on a comal and then ground; raw sauce, in which ingredients are ground and eaten without cooking; and a combination in which some of the elements are cooked. A molcajete or a blender can be used for the grinding process. Cooking or roasting the tomatillo will enhance the flavor, providing a sweeter salsa.[2] After the sauce is prepared, it can be cooked again in a pan with a little oil.
