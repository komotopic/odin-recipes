        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>Salsa verde is a type of spicy, green sauce in Mexican cuisine based on tomatillo and green chili peppers.

            The tomatillo-based Mexican salsa verde dates to the Aztec Empire, as documented by the Spanish physician Francisco Hernández, and is distinct from the various medieval European parsley-based green sauces.</p>

            <p>
                This green sauce comes in subtypes: cooked sauce, in which the ingredients are cooked and then ground; roasted salsa, in which the elements are roasted on a comal and then ground; raw sauce, in which ingredients are ground and eaten without cooking; and a combination in which some of the elements are cooked. A molcajete or a blender can be used for the grinding process. Cooking or roasting the tomatillo will enhance the flavor, providing a sweeter salsa.[2] After the sauce is prepared, it can be cooked again in a pan with a little oil.
            </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds tomatillos (about 12 medium), husked and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 to 2 medium jalapeños, stemmed (omit for mild salsa, use 1 jalapeño for medium salsa and 2 jalapeños for hot salsa, note that spiciness will depend on heat of actual peppers used)</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped white onion (about ½ medium onion)</li>
            <li>¼ cup packed fresh cilantro leaves (more if you love cilantro)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons to ¼ cup lime juice (1 to 2 medium limes, juiced), to taste</li>
            <li>½ to 1 teaspoon salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the broiler with a rack about 4 inches below the heat source. Place the tomatillos and jalapeño(s) on a rimmed baking sheet and broil until they’re blackened in spots, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven, carefully flip over the tomatillos and pepper(s) with tongs and broil for 4 to 6 more minutes, until the tomatillos are splotchy-black and blistered.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a food processor or blender, combine the chopped onion, cilantro, 2 tablespoons lime juice and ½ teaspoon salt. Once the tomatillos are out of the oven, carefully transfer the hot tomatillos, pepper(s) and all of their juices into the food processor or blender.</li>
            <li>Pulse until the mixture is mostly smooth and no big chunks of tomatillo remain, scraping down the sides as necessary. Season to taste with additional lime juice and salt, if desired.</li>
            
        </ol>
